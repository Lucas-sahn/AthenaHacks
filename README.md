# Step 3 - Compete in our Main Challenge
* The Code and Response Challenge calls on students to create practical, effective, and high-quality designs and applications based on cloud, data, and artificial intelligence, that can have an immediate and lasting impact on humanitarian issues. We challenge you to develop a solution that will support Natural Disaster Response and/or Mitigation. Additional details of the Code and Response Challenges are available at the following https://developer.ibm.com/code-and-response/

# Main Challenge Prizes
